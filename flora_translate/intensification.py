"""Deterministic process-intensification mandate helpers.

Sets IntensificationMandate.tau_reduction_target by reasoning about WHICH
batch limitations the flow design can remove. The chemistry agent identifies
the rate-limiting step in batch (mass-transfer, photon penetration, heat
removal, etc.); each limitation maps to an empirical intensification ceiling
that flow can routinely deliver. The mandate target is the MAX of all
applicable limitation-driven IFs — because removing the worst bottleneck
unlocks at least that intensification factor, and removing several
simultaneously cannot make things worse than the largest of them.

Background motivation: a 15 h aerobic photo-oxidation batch IS NOT a 5×
intensification opportunity. The reason it took 15 h is balloon O2 saturation
and a 5 mm path length where the center of the tube saw no photons. Both are
flow-removable bottlenecks worth >>5×. The previous static default of 6×
for photochem chronically under-intensified long batches.
